    <td>My main method for learning was look at the code that was already there, then I would think "how would I write this?" compare my idea to the flawed code that was already there, and then troubleshoot from then on. What's more, I used to learn python in my spare time, so I used my prior knowledge and then I Used that to troubleshoot. </td>
