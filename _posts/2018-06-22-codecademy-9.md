    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by looking at the instructions very carefully and the examples then carefully reading the question. Then I picked out the information given to me in the instructions, then I simply put my code into the console.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I was not doing as well as i had not retained the information from previous lessons well enough, this was one of the reasons that i was not as sharp this lesson </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I should do some codecademy work here and there in my spare time, as this will help me with my retention of information, and while im doing this, test myself as a retention test. This would increase my progression and let me learn more and become a better coder.</td>
