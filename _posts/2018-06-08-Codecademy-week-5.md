    <td>I found out that if I was stuck, I could go into the "hints" menu and it would point out common errors that people make and then I could check in my work for those errors, this helped me with aspects like confusing a “{“ for a “(“  and a “/“ for a “\” etc.. </td>

    <td>I think that I instantly forget the information I have just learned from one exercise, then have to figure out how to do a piece of code from scratch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I should keep the information fresh between lessons, by going over a few of the exercises in my free time, this would make me a better coder as I would then be able to do way more code. I would do this in less time too, as I would spend less time hopelessly wondering what i did last week.</td>
