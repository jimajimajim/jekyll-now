    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I found out that if I was stuck, I could go into the "hints" menu and it would point out common errors that people make and then I could check in my work for those errors,I think that I should also persevere so that when I was stuck I didn't just press solution.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I spend too much time a lesson helping the people next to me, so I didnâ€™t have as much time on my own work. This limited my learning. I also should not be distracted and be able to just work</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I should stop helping those around me when i need to get work done myself as that is slowing down my progression. I think that I if I completely focus then I will be better.</td>
  </tr>
