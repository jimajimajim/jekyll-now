  <tr>
    <td>I found out that if I was stuck, I could go into the "hints" menu and it would point out common errors that people make and then I could check in my work for those errors, this helped me with aspects like confusing a “{“ for a “(“  and a “/“ for a “\” etc.. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I spend too much time a lesson helping the people next to me, so I didn't have as much time on my own work. This limited my learning.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I should stop helping those around me when i need to get work done myself as that is slowing down my progression.</td>
